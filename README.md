# aoc solutions

My [advent-of-code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions in python.

Probably not quick or competitive. Hopefully intelligible.

Some use numpy.

These are tidy versions of my original solutions. I might add a revised version to note a better way of doing it or an alternative version to note a different way of doing it (references included where these were inspired by someone else's solution).
