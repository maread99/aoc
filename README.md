# aoc solutions

My [advent-of-code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions in python.

Probably not quick or competitive. Hopefully intelligible.

numpy / pandas used liberally.

These are tidy versions of my original solutions. I might add a revised version to note a better way of doing it, or simply if looking back at something in the original made me wince.
