"""Day 6: Wait For It

part a: 28mins (including an embarrassingly careless oversight)

part b: 37mins I clearly need to work on my appreciation of execution times
for different types of operations. I fell head first into the trap that had
been laid by the previous puzzles. On seeing seemingly large inputs I dived
into a binary search without bothering to consider that the size might
still permit the part a approach which would have been far slower to
execute, but quick enough and disproportionately quicker to implement...

total: 65mins, 13x bottom of the leaderboard.
