"""Day 18: RAM Run

NOTE: The `18_alt.py` solution's better.

part a: 51mins
Careless bug where I left a hard-coded 12 from the example! Ended up
printing out a representation of the path before I realised it. Should have
taken a THOROUGH LOOK through the code before plunging to such depths.
Then made a mess of the BFS by appending to the left of the queue rather
than the end ðŸ˜³. (Before spotting the error I solved with an overkill
priority queue, although the solution here shows a BFS.)

part b: 1hours 17mins
Didn't occur to me to just repeat part a for each newly fallen byte! I
wrongly assumed such an approach would take too long to execute! Should
have thought about it a bit more! I don't learn. (See `18_alt.py` which
takes < 10 secs to run and would have been much quicker to write!)

What did occur to me was to look for the first byte that results in a
continuous barrier existing from the south edge to either the north or east
edge (thereby cutting off the path from NW to SE).

(I actually solved part b with a far more inefficient implementation than
whats's here - from every new byte I tried to reach the south edge and
either the north or west edge. Took maybe 5 minutes.)

total: 2hours 8mins, 21.7x bottom of the leaderboard.
