# aoc solutions

My original [advent-of-code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions in python, tidied to varing degrees.

Probably not quick or competitive (at least Christmas side of around day 12). Hopefully intelligible.

I usually solve parts a and b separately. I won't force a combined solution at the expense of intelligibility, although I might use or add one (**_comb**) if part b is a natural evolution of part a or if part a can be easily extracted from part b.

After solving I might write a **rev**ised version to learn a better way of doing it or an **alt**ernative version to learn a different way of doing it (references included where these were inspired by someone else's solution).
