"""Day 7: Camel Cards

This version sorts with an absolute key function.
See 07_rev for the better comparision function version...

The sort based on absolute key values is quicker than the comparison
version, but we're only talking a second or so given the relatively short
list length.

part a: 61mins
Really annoying. Originally implemented the sort key as a comparision
function although couldn't get it working. Switched to a standard
function that resolved the evaluation 'in event of a tie' by adding a
decimal value to the rank and returning as a float (the version here).
Only then realised that the problem had been in the ranking function rather
than the way the comparison function had been implmented. Lost loads of
time with the unnecessary change of approach.

part b: 68mins
Lost time identifying a bug in the wildcard inputs. Bug due to evaluating
the non jokers as what was left in a set, which had the effect of treating
duplicates of other cards as jokers as well ðŸ˜³.

total: 129, 8x bottom of the leaderboard.
