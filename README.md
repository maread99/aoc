# aoc solutions

My original [advent-of-code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions in python, tidied to varing degrees.

Probably not quick or competitive (at least Christmas side of around day 12). Hopefully intelligible.

I usually solve parts a and b separately. I won't force a combined solution at the expense of intelligibility, although I might use or add one (**_comb**) if part b is a natural evolution of part a or if part a can be easily extracted from part b.

After solving I might write a **rev**ised version to learn a better way of doing it or an **alt**ernative version to learn a different way of doing it (references included where these were inspired by someone else's solution).

The README for each year serves as a reference of the key features of each solution.

### Solutions
- [hyper-nutrino](https://github.com/hyper-neutrino/advent-of-code) shares very competitive solutions and offers [video explanations](https://www.youtube.com/@hyper-neutrino) for each puzzle (hyper-nutrino can be frequently found at or towards the top of the day's leaderboard). My go-to "this is how you should have done it".
- [Jonathan Paulson](https://github.com/jonathanpaulson/AdventOfCode) is as good as always towards the top of the leaderboard. Publishes original solutions and videos [(here)](https://www.youtube.com/@jonathanpaulson5053) of real-time submissions streamed with a delay. Videos include post-submission explanations.
- [mebeim](https://github.com/mebeim/aoc) has been offering a walkthrough of (nearly all) aoc solutions since 2019.
- [iKevinY](https://github.com/iKevinY/advent) is a regular leaderboarder who publishes clear intelligible solutions.
- [oliver-ni](https://github.com/oliver-ni/advent-of-code) is a regular leaderboarder publishing solutions with minimal clean-up.
- [gahjelle](https://github.com/gahjelle/advent_of_code) frequently offers various solutions for a day, each offering a different approach.
- [nthistle](https://github.com/nthistle/advent-of-code) is a regular leaderboarder. Neil hasn't published solutions since 2022 although [here](https://www.youtube.com/@nthistlethwaite) he does continue to post (delayed) real-time videos of his often lightning quick solves, usually including an explanation at the end.


#### Solutions from previous years (not publishing in 2024)
- [MasterMedo](https://github.com/MasterMedo/aoc) hasn't published solutions since 2023 although regularly published solutions in previous years. I've found some real gems in here offering novel, efficient implementations.
- [Viliam Pucik](https://github.com/viliampucik/adventofcode) doesn't usually do all the puzzles each year (and hasn't published solutions since 2023), although among those Viliam has solved I've found to be some of the best solutions I've seen anywhere (look at [day 25 2022](https://github.com/viliampucik/adventofcode/blob/master/2022/25.py) and weep).
